#Patran Neutral Mesh File Writer

Back in 2011, wrote this small little frotran program to write out patran neutral mesh file given coords and mesh connectivity information.

This was lying on my blog and it recently needed some modification and a active testcase, so thought it might be useful to have it on github.
